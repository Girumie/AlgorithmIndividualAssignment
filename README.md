Linked List-Based Stack Implementation
Overview
This project presents a stack implementation using a linked list structure in C++. It consists of three files: an interface header file, an implementation header file, 
and an executable C++ file.

Files
stack_linked_list_interface.hpp - Defines the stack class and its core operations.

stack_linked_list_implementation.hpp - Implements the stack functionality using a linked list.

stack_linked_list_main.cpp - Contains the executable implementation of stack operations.

Usage
To compile and run the project, use the following command:

sh
g++ stack_linked_list_main.cpp -o stackExecutable  
./stackExecutable  

This implementation demonstrates fundamental stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and isEmpty using a linked list approach. 
Kindly review the structure and logic, and feel free to provide feedback.
